Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-form.git
cd contact-form


Install dependencies

npm install


Create a .env file in the project root:

EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
PORT=5000


Make sure you generate a Gmail App Password if you have 2FA enabled.

Start the server

node server.js


The server will run at http://localhost:5000. Your static form should post to /send.

Usage

Place your static site in the public/ folder.

Customize the HTML form to fit your website’s design.

Ensure the form posts to /send with the following fields:

name (string)

email (string)

message (string)

Test sending messages—emails will arrive at the address you set in mailOptions.to.
